## Project Summary
Real-time Korean→English captioning appliance for church services. Audio from USB mixer → Gemini Live API (`gemini-3.5-live-translate-preview`) → English captions over SSE + translated audio over binary WebSocket → attendee phones. Single session per 60–90 min service. Port: **8080** (set in `config.yaml`).

## Key Design Decisions
These are the non-obvious decisions that can't be derived by reading the code. Don't re-run these experiments.

- **`gemini-3.1-flash-live-preview` is banned**: crashes after ~30s of continuous audio (error 1011 keepalive timeout). Do not use as fallback. Confirmed Phase 12 Round 3.
- **`translation_config` is mandatory, `system_instruction` does nothing**: the translate model requires `translation_config` to activate translation mode. `system_instruction` is accepted by the API but silently ignored by the internal engine. Confirmed Phase 12 Round 2. Don't re-test this.
- **`turn_complete` removed as a commit trigger**: fires on filler utterances ("um", "uh") in sermon speech → excessive fragmentation. Do not re-introduce. Caption lines are committed after 1.5s silence (`PAUSE_THRESHOLD_S`).
- **`SessionResumptionConfig` + `SlidingWindow` are mandatory**: without them the session drops every ~10 min. This is not optional.
- **Port fallback rejected**: if port is in use, show a message + open browser to running service + exit. Do not silently pick a new port — it would break attendee QR codes and cause audio device conflicts.
- **Voice pinned to `orus`**: without `SpeechConfig → PrebuiltVoiceConfig(voice_name="orus")`, Gemini picks a random voice on every GoAway reconnect — audibly jarring mid-sermon.
- **CaptionKit can run in parallel**: Windows shared-mode audio driver allows both apps on the same USB mixer simultaneously. No virtual audio cable needed.
- **`skc_build` conda env for exe builds**: the `agent` env includes PyTorch (~2.5 GB), producing a 3 GB exe. Use the minimal `skc_build` env for ~70 MB output. See `docs/BUILD_EXE.en.md` for full details.
